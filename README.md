## Hi there, I'm David ðŸ‘‹

:mushroom: I come from a computational biology background, but have a general interest in software engineering and data science/engineering.

âœ” I currently teach and advise on [good programming practices in UK Government analysis and research](https://best-practice-and-impact.github.io/qa-of-code-guidance/intro.html).

:octocat: I'm a huge advocate of open source and a keen contributor in my spare time.
