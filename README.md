## Hi there, I'm David ðŸ‘‹

âœ” I work to promote [good programming practices in UK Government analysis and research](https://github.com/best-practice-and-impact).

:octocat: I'm a huge advocate of open source and a keen contributor in my spare time.

:mushroom: I come from a computational biology background, but have an interest in software engineering, data science and other hackery.
